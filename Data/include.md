## **Fatal Car Accidents Across Ohio â€“ Shiny App Overview**

### Created by Team 5: The R Traffic Controllers

Accidents, such as vehicle crashes, are said to be the fourth leading cause of death in the United
States and the leading cause of death for individuals ages 1-44 (Medical News Today, 2017).
The number of car accidents is especially high in the United States because driving oneself is the
most common form of transportation used by Americans. With millions of Americans driving on
the roadways, fatal accidents are an unfortunate possibility. Although there are many factors that
can affect the number and type of fatal car accidents, this app focuses on the cause(s) of the
crash, weather conditions, and time of week/day among the six largest cities in Ohio (by
population). This app utilizes data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA); an organization that studies vehicle safety and driving behavior to reduce vehicle
crashes (United States Department of Transportation, 2018). Establishing a broader
understanding of when and where fatal accidents occur across the state of Ohio can lead to
greater awareness of this phenomenon.
